    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.\n",

    "# Function:\n",
    "A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\n",

    "# 1. Class:\n",
    "A class describes the contents of the objects that belong to it. It describes an aggregate of data fields (called instance variables), and defines the operations (called methods).\n",
    "# 2. Object:\n",
    "An object is an element (or instance) of a class. Objects have the behaviors of their class.\n",
    "# 3. Attribute:\n",
    "In Object-oriented programming(OOP), classes and objects have attributes. Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. In short, attributes store information about the instance.\n",
    "# 4. Behavior:\n",
    "A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them."
